# Getting started with Kafka Streams

Demo repository for my article [Getting started with Kafka
Streams](https://lucapette.me/writing/getting-started-with-kafka-streams).

The easiest way to play around with the code is to run:

```sh
scripts/seed.sh # Assumes you have a stock Kafka installation in $HOME/kafka
```

to load the sample data and run the project from IntelliJ.
